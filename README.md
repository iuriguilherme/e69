e69
===

Yet another project started and mirrored on github.  

This one is about IOT, remote APIs, smartphone apps, and automating urban \
gardening.  

This project currently doesn't have a name, 'e69' was the next name in line \
in my list of personal projects for recreative purposes.

It's LGPLv3, see [LICENSE](./LICENSE)  

Why LGPLv3 and not MPL or LGPLv2? Because I spent six hours researching for \
the most suited on to this software and that was my decision. One point that \
influenced at the final moments was that LGPLv3 forbid  s tivoization which \
is undesirable.
